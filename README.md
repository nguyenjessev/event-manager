# Event Manager
This event manager takes a CSV file of users and outputs personalized HTML files for each user, showing them who their local legislators are along with their websites

## Problems
Read from a file, parse the contents, use the data to fetch info from an API, then create customzied webpages (letters) for each user

## What I used
Ruby libraries (CSV, Google Civic API, ERB), Ruby's File class, ERB templates

## What I learned
How to request information from an API, read file contents, and use ERB templates to dynamically generate files
